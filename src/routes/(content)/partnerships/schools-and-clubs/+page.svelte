	into our framework, receive support and resources from us, and begin implementing these principles
	within your organisation's daily practices.
</TextSection>
<TextSection level="2">
	But the journey doesn't stop there. Once your organisation has successfully embedded our

	educational experiences for your learners.

<TextSection level="2">

<SectionHeading title="Policy Alignment Process" />
<TextSection level="2">
	Embarking on a journey with Project Partners and the Engaged Education partners network entails
	aligning your school or club's practices with our core principles, embodied in our policy
	expectations. Here's a comprehensive look at what this process involves:
</TextSection>

<SectionHeading title="Policies of Focus" level="3" />
<TextSection level="2">
	Our policy alignment process puts emphasis on three key areas: safeguarding, anti-discrimination,
	and governance policies.
</TextSection>
<ListContainer level="2">
	<ListItem>
		<span class="font-bold">Safeguarding Policies</span> - In line with our commitment to ensure a safe
		learning environment, we need to be certain that our partner organisations prioritise student welfare.
		Policies related to this cover areas like child protection, handling disclosures, and anti-bullying
		measures.
	</ListItem>
	<ListItem>
		<span class="font-bold">Anti-Discrimination Policies</span> - Our network values diversity and inclusion.
		We insist that partners should have clear anti-discrimination policies promoting an equal, non-discriminatory
		learning and working environment.
	</ListItem>
	<ListItem>
		<span class="font-bold">Governance Policies</span> - The manner in which our partner organisations
		are managed and operated matters to us. We seek clarity on the governance structure, decision-making
		processes, financial management, and conflict of interest procedures.
	</ListItem>
</ListContainer>

<SectionHeading title="Policy Alignment Assessment" level="3" />
<TextSection level="2">
	Our policy alignment assessment process is not meant to be intimidating, but rather to ensure that
	we share the same values and principles. It involves a detailed declaration from your school or
	club highlighting how your policies align with our expectations. We require specific wording and
	references to your internal policy documents to ensure a comprehensive understanding of your
	practices.
</TextSection>

<SectionHeading title="Policy Alignment Assistance" level="3" />
<TextSection level="2">
	We understand that some organisations might lack certain policies. Rest assured, we're here to
	help. Should your school or club lack any internal policy in line with our expectations, we're
	more than willing to share relevant materials that will guide you in drafting and implementing
	these policies.
</TextSection>

<SectionHeading title="Policy Revision" level="3" />
<TextSection level="2">
	Our commitment to collaboration shines through the policy alignment process. If your initial
	declaration lacks some information, we'll advise you on what further policy areas need to be
	addressed. We appreciate that policy alignment takes time and effort; there are no penalties for
	requiring some additional time or guidance.
</TextSection>

<SectionHeading title="Policy Maintenance" level="3" />
<TextSection level="2">
	Becoming a partner in the Engaged Education partners network means embracing a journey of
	continuous improvement. All provisional and certified partners may be requested to engage in a
	policy review process intermittently. Also, as our policy requirements evolve, we might ask
	partners to go through an accelerated policy alignment process. This ongoing commitment to policy
	alignment helps to ensure the safety and positive impact of our entire network and promotes the
	sharing of best practices.
</TextSection>

<SectionHeading title="Becoming a Provisional Partner: The Onboarding Journey" />
<TextSection level="2">
	Becoming a Provisional Partner is the first milestone on your journey with the Engaged Education
	partners network. It signifies the start of a transformative process as you begin to align your
	organisation's values and practices with the engaged education model. As a Provisional Partner,
	you become part of a global community dedicated to transforming education, and you gain access to
	a wealth of resources designed to facilitate your growth.
</TextSection>

<SectionHeading title="Commencement of the Journey" level="3" />
<TextSection level="2">
	Becoming a Provisional Partner commences when you've successfully completed the policy alignment
	process. This process ensures your school or club aligns with our shared values and principles,
	and meets our requirements for safe governance. The moment you become a Provisional Partner, you
	begin your active journey towards engaged education.
</TextSection>

<SectionHeading title="Responsibilities of a Provisional Partner" level="3" />
<TextSection level="2">
	As a Provisional Partner, you are entrusted with the task of building an environment that fosters
	engaged learning. It is your responsibility to promote the principles of engaged education within
	your organisation and to start the process of embedding these principles in your daily practices.
	We believe in a collaborative process of change, so it is important that this transformation is
	co-constructed and shaped by all the stakeholders in your organisation - from leaders to teachers
	to learners.
</TextSection>

<SectionHeading title="The Onboarding Process" level="3" />
<TextSection level="2">
	The onboarding process is a collaborative journey designed to facilitate a smooth transition
	towards becoming a certified partner. This process is geared towards aligning your organisation
	with our framework and helping you navigate the challenges that might arise along the way. It
	involves a range of activities and steps designed to deepen your understanding of engaged
	education and to build your capacity to implement it effectively.
</TextSection>

<TextSection level="2">
	During the onboarding process, we provide an array of resources and guidance to support your
	journey. These include implementation documents, supporting materials, and example projects for
	learners. All these resources are available online and are designed to provide you with a
	comprehensive understanding of our philosophy and methods.
</TextSection>

<SectionHeading title="Support During Onboarding" level="3" />
<TextSection level="2">
	We understand that the transformation process can be complex and challenging. As such, we provide
	substantial support during the onboarding phase to ensure a smooth transition. We offer weekly
	webinars open to all Provisional Partners, where you can learn from our experts and your fellow
	partners, share your experiences, and discuss any issues or questions you might have.
</TextSection>

<TextSection level="2">
	We're also piloting the possibility of providing printed materials to Provisional Partners where
	necessary. While our resources are limited, we strive to make sure every Provisional Partner feels
	supported and has the necessary tools to succeed in their journey.
</TextSection>

<TextSection level="2">
	The journey from being a Provisional Partner to a Certified Partner is a transformative process,
	one which invites you to question, reflect, adapt, and grow. It's an enriching journey that will
	equip your organisation with the tools to create a vibrant learning environment that is aligned
	with the principles of engaged education. So, embark on this journey with us and be a part of the
	future of education.
</TextSection>

<SectionHeading title="Becoming a Certified Partner" />
<TextSection level="2">
	The path to becoming a Certified Partner with the Engaged Education partners network is not just a
	process, but a reflective journey. This journey engages every corner of your organisation: from
	school and club leaders, teachers, and administrators, to students, parents, and supporters. This
	collaborative endeavour signifies not just your commitment to improving education, but also your
	successful implementation of our guiding principles and framework.
</TextSection>

<SectionHeading title="The Certification Submission" level="3" />
<TextSection level="2">
	The certification submission is your opportunity to showcase your unique journey. Express your
	experiences, learnings, and reflections in a format that suits your organisation: it could be a
	written account, an audio-visual presentation, or a mix of these. While a typical written
	submission usually contains at least 5000 words, there is no set minimum or limit. The focus
	should be on authenticity and a truthful representation of your journey.
</TextSection>

<SectionHeading title="A Guided Process" level="3" />
<TextSection level="2">
	To help structure your thoughts and reflections, we provide a template and guidelines. These will
	aid you in touching on key areas and milestones such as your attitudes towards teachers'
	professional development, changes in students' learning experiences, leadership development, and
	community engagement.
</TextSection>

<SectionHeading title="Submission and Review" level="3" />
<TextSection level="2">
	We accept submissions twice a month, on the 1st and 15th of every calendar month. After
	submission, your work will be reviewed by a panel comprising members of the Project Partners team
	and trusted partners. Our review is not a pass/fail examination, but an appreciation of the
	evidence of shared principles in action, in the context of your unique journey.
</TextSection>

<SectionHeading title="Feedback and Continuous Improvement" level="3" />
<TextSection level="2">
	After the submission review, all organisations will receive comprehensive feedback from our panel.
	Rather than a simple pass or fail judgment, this feedback aims to provide constructive and
	detailed insights into the observed impacts of the elements in your submission. It highlights
	areas of strength and areas where the impact could be further enhanced.
</TextSection>
<TextSection level="2">
	This feedback serves as a stepping-stone for continuous learning and improvement, embodying our
	ethos as an educational establishment. If your organisation does not become a Certified Partner on
	the first submission, the feedback provides a pathway for further growth and alignment with the
	principles of the Engaged Education network.
</TextSection>
<TextSection level="2">
	Subsequent submissions are welcomed and even encouraged. If you choose to reapply, we ask you to
	include a list of changes made in response to the previous feedback. This serves to illustrate the
	continuous improvement process your organisation is undergoing.
</TextSection>
<TextSection level="2">
	Our review process is structured to take into account the unique context of each school or club.
	For instance, if your organisation operates with limited resources, we bear this in mind while
	assessing your submission. By focusing on the quality of reflection and the evidence of applying
	the principles of Engaged Education, we ensure our process is fair and inclusive.
</TextSection>
<TextSection level="2">
	This process is an integral part of your journey with the Engaged Education partners network. It
	provides an opportunity for deep introspection and learning, and a platform for sharing this
	learning with the wider community. We look forward to joining you on this exciting journey towards
	becoming a Certified Partner.
</TextSection>

<SectionHeading title="Support" level="3" />
<TextSection level="2">
	Throughout the process, our resources remain at your disposal. We offer guides, webinars, and
	limited one-on-one support, all designed to facilitate your journey towards certification. After
	your submission, we strive to provide thorough review and feedback within two months.
</TextSection>

<SectionHeading title="Language" level="3" />
<TextSection level="2">
	We are committed to hearing your voice in the language most natural to you. If you wish to submit
	in a language other than English, please get in touch with us prior to starting your certification
	process. While we will do our best to accommodate this, please understand it might extend the
	review period. Feedback will be provided in English.
</TextSection>

<SectionHeading title="Life as a Certified Partner" />
