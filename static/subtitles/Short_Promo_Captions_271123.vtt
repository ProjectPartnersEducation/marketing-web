00:00:04.295 --> 00:00:07.215
Project Partners was
set up as an international collaboration

00:00:07.215 --> 00:00:11.344
between UK and Ghana
in order to be able to realise engaging

00:00:11.553 --> 00:00:15.265
and exciting new types of learning.

00:00:15.306 --> 00:00:17.642
Project Partners wants to try and change

00:00:17.642 --> 00:00:21.062
the mindset of learning, away from
being told what to do and more towards

00:00:21.229 --> 00:00:26.568
celebrating the individual approaches
that every person has to a problem.

00:00:26.651 --> 00:00:27.819
As we look to grow

00:00:27.944 --> 00:00:30.822
more as a charity,
we're looking to be able to provide

00:00:31.031 --> 00:00:35.410
resources and materials
across the spectrum of different needs.

00:00:35.618 --> 00:00:37.704
What we hope is to inspire
a global movement

00:00:37.704 --> 00:00:39.831
towards engagement-focused learning

00:00:39.998 --> 00:00:43.626
and really give the tools in the classroom
to be able to make those things real.
